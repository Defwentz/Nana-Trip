# Nana-Trip
a soft body physics game in progress
a lot of ideas... (ok, maybe not that much)

TODO(maybe):
hp system
using sensor to add slow zone
tiny square stalker that follows nana around, and maybe sacrifice against the boss, maybe slow it down a little, or just act like a spare life
soft-tissue terrain
